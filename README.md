To start the canvas project: 

``` canvas-sketch sketch.js --open ```

Use **command + K** to save a file from chrome.

Can be opened on the mobile phone if the phone's connected to the same network.

**WebGL**

``` canvas-sketch webgl.js --open ```

As soon as you saved all the images in one folder (`canvas-sketch webgl.js --output=tmp/
` and push cmd+shift+s), you can use ffmpeg or https://giftool.surge.sh/ to create a gif from the set of images.

**Shaders**

``` canvas-sketch shader.js --open ```
